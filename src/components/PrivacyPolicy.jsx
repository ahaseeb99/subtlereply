            How We Protect Your Personal Data

            In order to protect your security, we use the strongest available
            browser encryption and store all of our data on servers in secure
            facilities. Our employees are bound by strict confidentiality
            agreements and a breach of this agreement would result in the

            While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is
            secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk
            of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and
            therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data
            beyond what is reasonably practical.
